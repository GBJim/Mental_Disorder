Predicted that group discussion would enhance positive mood effects on judgments but inhibit affectively based distortions in dysphoric moods in a study of 144 undergraduates. Positive, neutral, and negative moods were induced using audiovisual presentations. Individual and group consensus judgments of 9 person categories on 3 dimensions (evaluation, competence, and self-confidence) were obtained in 2 sessions. Ss made more positive judgments when happy, and more negative judgments when sad than when in the neutral mood. Group discussion resulted in a further polarization of positive judgments and the attenuation of negative judgments. Findings support the role affect plays in mediating individual cognitive processes and interactive social behaviors.
