Examined the effects of arbitrarily placed boundaries on judged similarity between pairs of stimulus persons. Psychology students in Exps 1 ( n = 76) and 2 ( n = 97) rated the similarity of applicants for a job in which 3 category labels (Ideal, Acceptable, and Marginal) were superimposed on the composite scores of applicants based on measures relevant to job performance. The exact position of the category boundaries, described to the Ss as arbitrary, was varied across 2 conditions. Ss in both experiments rated pairs as more similar when in the same category than when on opposite sides of a category boundary. In Exp 3, psychology students rated pairs of movie actors on 3 scales assessing dispositional similarity, based upon the degree of the actor's political liberalism on a percentile scale. The presence of semantic labels, as well as visual boundary markers, was varied, and again confirmed the predicted effects of boundary markers. The presence of a no-categorization control indicated the presence of both intercategory accentuation and intracategory minimization. Moreover, actors separated by objectively large distances within a category were seen as more similar than actors objectively smaller distances apart but separated by a category boundary.
